A Goal refers to a set of properties of the [[uses:Agent World]] that an [[uses:Agent]] tends to achieve in some period of time.

Example
 - A plant might grow higher over some period of time, thus we can say the plant's goal in this time period is to grow higher.
 - If it is very hot outside and an animal drinks from a watering hole, we might say that the goal over that period of time for the animal agent was to drink water.
