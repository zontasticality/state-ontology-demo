title: How the Internet Resists The State
type: argument
---

Much like how the people of Zomia have various tactics to resist the State and prevent it from taking control[1](^1), various parts of the [[uses:The Internet|Internet]] also resists the State, and very effectively I might add.

While to resist the state in the physical world requires subsistence lifestyles, particular social structures, and certain geography, those who wish to escape state control on the Internet, do not need to leave their own house. It is possible right from within the state itself, with the power of Math!

Some notable examples of state-circumventing technologies this are:
 - TOR (Started by a State (the USA), weirdly enough) (Uncensorable and untraceable)
 - Peer-to-peer / federated protocols (Uncontrollable by a single entity, hard to regulate and impose order on) [2]
 - VPNs (Circumvent common blocks)
 - Encrypted Communication (Prevents state surveilance, depending on context)
