# Bourgeois State

Defines [[defines:The State]] to be an entity that exists to manage the inherent conflict between [[uses:Social Classification|socioeconomic classes]] caused by the economic consequences of capitalism. Usually for the benefit of one class (the bourgeoisie) over the others.

### Justifications

According to [[quotes:Quote - Engels on The State]], the state must necessarily arise due to inherent conflict between classes of people with conflicting economic interests.

This is substantiated by another Marxist scholar: [[quotes:Quote - Lenin on The State]] who calls the state "the product and the manifestation of the irreconcilability of class contradictions".
