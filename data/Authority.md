title: Authority
type: definition

Authority is a [[is-a:Behavioral Conception]] and [[is-a:Social Construct]] where [[uses:Agent]]s in a [[uses:Society]] collectively tend to defer decision-making to a particular Agent or [[uses:Organization]]. This deference is self-reinforcing: individual agents find it rational to defer because enough other agents also defer, forming a game-theoretic equilibrium maintained through [[uses:Social Connection]]s.

Authority is what makes Weber's "monopoly on violence" *legitimate* - the monopoly works not just because the state *can* use force, but because people collectively *accept* that it should. Authority can shift or collapse when this equilibrium breaks down.
