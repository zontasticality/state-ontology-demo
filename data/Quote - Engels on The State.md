> "The state is a product of society at a certain stage of development; the state is the recognition that this society has become entangled in an irresoluble contradiction with itself, that it is divided into irreconcilable antagonisms which it is powerless to escape. But in order that these antagonisms, classes with conflicting economic interests, might not devour each other and society in sterile struggle, a power seemingly standing above society became necessary for the purpose of moderating the conflict, keeping it within the bounds of ‘order’. And this power, which has arisen out of society but placed itself above it and increasingly alienated itself from it, is the state."
