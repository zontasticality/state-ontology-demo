title: Final Project Guidelines
type: other

Due: Wed Dec 20

Your final project for this course is relatively open. It should in general incorporate a summation of
some of the major themes from the course. Here are some prompts for you to consider:
 - Choose a concept that seems to run throughout this course, or at least through several authors.
Make an argument for which author(s) make a more compelling argument. In doing so, be sure
to explain their major points of agreement or disagreement on the concept. This could include
things like the use of state power in social change, an analysis of how specific forms of
identities are used for social control, etc.
 - Use concepts from the course to analyze relations of power in an institution you are a part of or
interact with. This could be your workspace, local government, college, family, etc.
 - Use concepts from the course to analyze a proposed solution to a pressing political issue that
involves significant use of the State, and/or critique of use of the State. Use the course material
to analyze if these proposals were getting at the root of the problem, if they were doing enough
to address the real underlying issues, and potential unforeseen consequences of using the State
in this way. For example, you could analyze a particular argument for reparations for slavery, a
climate treaty or environmental program, initiatives to be more inclusive in education, reforms
to the justice system, etc.
 - Use concepts from the course to compare and contrast 2-3 works of fiction or art in which the
State plays a significant role. Explain the core methods of domination that are represented in
these works, including those that go beyond overt physical violence. Contrast some of the
major differences, and explanations for these differences.
 - Some other paper idea that incorporates the course material in a comprehensive way, similar to
the above prompts. Your proposed final topic must be approved by me no later than Friday,
Nov 29. Please make sure to run your ideas by me far in advance if you are thinking about this
option! I may request more details, or a revised proposal.
 - Use a skill you have developed in another course to do a non-written final project that
incorporates the major themes from this course. You will still need to turn something in for me
to evaluate with this option, in addition to incorporating the course materials and outside
sources in some way, so please discuss this with me, especially if it’s not something that’s
easily shared online. I also expect this option to be of the same effort/quality/rigor that it would
take to make a paper option (as in, something you work at least a few weeks on and produce a
quality output, not a video you shoot with your phone the night before). Note also that you
can’t turn in the same work for two classes, but I’m willing to discuss some kind of larger
combined project with another course (if your other professor agrees as well). Your proposed
final project must be approved by me no later than Friday, Nov 29. Please make sure to run
your ideas by me far in advance if you are thinking about this option!
General guidelines:
 - Papers should be in the 6-8 page range (not including your bibliography/works cited pages),
with standard one inch margins, 12 point standard font, and double spacing.
 - Use your annotated bibliography as your guide. You must use at least three items from the
syllabus, three other published outside sources, and other sources as needed.
   - If you end up figuring out you don’t need a particular source you listed on your annotated
bibliography, or need to add another, that’s fine. If you end up using additional sources
that meet the paper’s guidelines, that’s also fine. The purpose of that assignment was just
to have you start thinking about your topic and which works to use, with the
understanding that some of them may not have ended up being as relevant. However,
you should not significantly change your approved topic without checking in with me.
   - The upper limit of how many sources you need to use depends on your topic. Make sure
you don’t leave out course material that is directly relevant to your topic. For example, if
you were writing about the State and warmaking, and didn’t mention someone like Tilly,
that would be a glaring omission. Part of the intention behind the annotated bibliography
assignment is to make sure we’ve identified the most relevant readings from the start.
 - Include citations in an officially recognized standard format with page numbers. If I
commented on your short paper that you weren’t doing this in a recognizable format, please
ask for help! You can find lots of great writing resources at the Purdue Online Writing Lab,
and the Writing Center is also a great resource on campus.
 - Include an alphabetized bibliography/works cited page. (You should have this almost
entirely completed because you already made an annotated bibliography! Just delete the
descriptions, and add in any changes to your sources.)
 - I have made the due date as late as possible for me to be able to at least briefly look at papers
to see if they are complete enough to file a preliminary evaluation by the deadline a few days
later. If you are someone who has trouble making deadlines, or has a lot of work due around
the same time, set an earlier due date for yourself. I’m giving you this assignment far in
advance so you can have maximum flexibility. In total, you have over two months to work
on this project (from the time I posted this assignment on Moodle and mentioned it in class),
which is several more times more than such a project would typically take.
   - This format meets almost all of the official OARS accommodations for extended time on
an assignment. If you believe your accommodation means you should get more time than
this, you must check in with me no later than Nov 29th so we can work out a plan.
 - Please sign up for office hours! I’m happy to discuss any phase of this project with you, even
at a brainstorming stage.
