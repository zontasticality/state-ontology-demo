title: How to the definitions of the State compare?
type: argument
---

This argument uses the criteria outlined in [[uses:How to Empirically find the Perfect Definition]] and [[cites:Gerring - 1999 - What Makes a Concept Good? A Criterial Framework for Understanding Concept Formation in the Social Sciences|What Makes a Concept Good]] to (somewhat-subjectively) compare 3 definitions of the state: [[uses:Weber's State|Weberian State]], [[uses:Bourgeois State]], and the [[uses:Socially Constructed State]].

### Criteria #1: Familiarity

In terms of common familiarity, concepts like "Monopoly on Violence" (Weber), "Irreconcilability of Class Antagonisms" (Engels), or "Local Field of Power" (Migdal) are pretty outside of normal lingo. However, for those who read the literature, or have enough intuitition to piece together the meaning from context, there are probably worse options. If I had to pick a subjective ordering however, I would go Weber > Engels > Migdal.

### Criteria #2: Resonance

I'd say the term **"The State"** (bold for emphasis) is pretty resonant, very le epic as the kids. Although it is possibly an overloaded word considering the concept of "the state of x" exists.

Out of all the definitions, however, I'd say that the Socially Constructed State is the most resonant with me. "Fields of Power" sounds cool!

## Criteria #3: Parisomy

Ditto Criteria #2 for the term, the term is very short.

The definitions on the other hand... both the Bourgeois and the Socially Constructed State in some sense build off of Weber's, which makes Weber have the shortest list of characteristics.

## Criteria #4: Coherence

### 4.1: Consistency

Given that all these definitions were taken from academics, there is no clear surface level inconsistencies, but there may be some edge cases where one or another definition runs into issues.

### 4.2: Property Relatedness

Okay lets break this one down.

Weber's State - The properties of: Monopoly on Violence, Organization, Territory, Imposition of an Order, do have shared underlying concepts such as:
 - Monopoly on Violence, Territory (i.e. Monopoly on Land), and Imposition of an Order (Monopoly on rules) all relate via the property of "[[mention:Monopoly]]".
 - They also all have to do with [[mention:society]], organization, territory, order, etc.
 - There are likely many more connections between the attributes of Weber's State, but these should suffice for now to show that Weber's State is a roughly Coherent item.

The Bourgeois State - This shares nearly all its attributes with Weber's State, only adding two main ideas: The idea that the state arose necessarily due to class conflict, and the nature of the order the state imposes being to manage that conflict (generally to the advantage of one class over the other). This also should satisfy property relatedness, at least in what it receives from Weber, but also between the two added on properties, both relating to the work Marx did studying capitalism.

Socially Constructed State - This also shares many of its attributes with Weber's State, but instead of characterizing them as axiomatic properties, it characterizes them as emergent properties of a more complicated network of power, that we observe patterns in and then socially construct a concept like the state, and that different conceptions of this emergent social construction could arise in different places (i.e. with states that don't completely satisfy Weber's definition, but are often considered states, or state-like).
 - This definition I would argue is *more* coherent than Weber's or the Bourgeois State, given that it loosens the conception of the state, allowing more possible relations between its properties.


## Criteria #5: Differentiation

Differentiation is just how small of a concept space the definition carves out of the Universal Ontology (or at least thats how I like to think of it).

For these definitions, this property is pretty easy to see. The Bourgeois State allows for the most differentiation, as you could theoretically conceive of Weberian states that aren't capitalist. Weber is in the middle, and the Socially Constructed State allows for the least differentiation (because it recognizes some not-strictly-Weberian states).

## Criteria #6: Depth

Depth depends on how many auxiliary properties can be bundled under the umbrella of the concept being analyzed. For this, I posit that the Socially Constructed State takes the cake, simply because of how wide a net it spreads and how many different relationships can be made within this wide net. While this wide net does lose it some ground when it comes to differentiation, 

## Criteria #7: Theoretical Utility

The property of Theoretical Utility is, for sociological concepts at least, in some sense tied to how much research has been done with the definition. I am by no means an expert in the discourse around these 3 definitions, but if I had to make an educated guess, I would suspect that the Social Conception of the State has less Theoretical Utility due to being around for much less time (although it may surpass the other two in the future?), and that the Bourgeois and Weberian State have more Theoretical Utility. This is something that could be measured much more precisely by building ontologies that represent all that has been said on the topic.

## Criteria #8: Field Utility

The sources that outline the socially-constructed state (i.e. [[mention:Mitchel - 1991 - The Limits of the State|Mitchel]], [[mention:Migdal and Schlichte - 2005 - Dynamics of States - Rethinking the State|Migdal and Schlichte]]), set out to redefine the state to solve some inconsistencies between the semantic field's conception of the state and what was happening to states in the real world. So, between the 3 definitions, I'd say the Socially Constructed State has the most field utility as it was invented to improve our understanding of concepts relating to the state.
