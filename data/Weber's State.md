title: Weber's State
type: definition
---
[[defines:The State]] is an [[is_a:Organization]] with the goal of maintaining an [[uses:Order]] within a [[uses:Territory]].

This Order contains:
 - Self-Preservation
 - An imposed [[uses:Sharable Conception]] on what kind of [[uses:Violence]] is permitted.

 using an implied or actual [[uses:Monopoly]] on the [[uses:Use of Violence]].

Note: I don't include "Meaning of Violence" in this

"A "ruling organization" will be called "political" insofar as its existence and order is continuously safeguarded within a given territorial area by the threat and application of physical force on the part of the administrative staff. A compulsory political organization with continuous operations (politischer Anstaltsbetrieb) will be called a "state" insofar as its administrative staff successfully upholds the claim to the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force in the enforcement of its order."
