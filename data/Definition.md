A definition is technically [[is-a:Sharable Conception]] (although most often encountered as a [[mention:Social Construct]]), typically expressed as a series of words in a [[uses:Language]] that attempts to relate other implicitly defined concepts to form a meaningful [[mention:Structure]].

You can see a representation of such a structure explicitly laid out (and hopefully a little more concretely defined) by looking at all the blue nodes in the graph vis of this Ontology :)
