title: Social Construct
type: definition
---

A Social Construct [[is-a:Entity]] abstractly constructed via a [[is-a:Sharable Conception]] that goes through a [[is-a:Process]] of propagation through a [[uses:Society]] via [[uses:Social Connection]]s. Social Constructs are, however, constantly evolving in time. It is but an illusion (or, a construction, you might say) of a shared concept that is cemented through equilibrium of inter-[[mention:Agent]] connection.
