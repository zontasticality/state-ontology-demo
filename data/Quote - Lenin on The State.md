> This expresses with complete clarity the basic idea of Marxism on the question of the historical role and significance of the state. The state is the product and the manifestation of the irreconcilability of class contradictions. The state arises where, when and to the extent that class contradictions objectively cannot be reconciled. And, conversely, the existence of the state demonstrates that the
class contradictions are irreconcilable. It is precisely on this most important and basic point that the distortion of Marxism, proceeding along two main lines, begins.

> On the one hand, the bourgeois and the petty-bourgeois ideologists, compelled under the pressure of indisputable historical facts to recognize that the state only exists where there are class contradictions and class struggle, ‘correct’ Marx in such a way as to make it appear that the state is an organ for the reconciliation of classes. According to Marx, the state could neither arise nor endure if it were possible to reconcile classes. According to Marx, the state is an organ of class rule, an organ for the oppression of one class by another; it is the creation of ‘order’, legalizing and perpetuating this oppression by moderating the clashes among the classes. In the opinion of petty-bourgeois politicians, order means precisely the reconciliation of classes and not the oppression of one class by another; to moderate the conflict means to reconcile classes and not to deprive the oppressed classes of definite means and methods of struggle for the overthrow of their oppressors.
