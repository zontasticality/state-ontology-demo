title: Socially Constructed State
type: definition
---

[[defines:The State]] is a [[is_a:Social Construct]] that [[uses:Human]]s mistake as a coherent independent entity (when it is in fact socially constructed). They characterize The State as a conceptual abstract over a power field representing the actual flow of power to which an order is established.

## Justification

The difference between Migdal and Schlichte's State and Weber's view of the State being a coherent autonomous organization is that Weber conceives of the state as something very static while Migdal, Schlichte, and Mitchel acknowledge the social constructedness of the state.
