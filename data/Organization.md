Type: [[is-a:Sharable Conception]]

An Organization is a [[is-a:Structure]] where the [[uses:Structural Element]]s are [[uses:Human]]s and the [[uses:Relation]] is a [[is-a:Sharable Conception]] of what the organization's function and goals are.

This Conception-Structure can alternatively be modeled as an [[is-a:Optimizing Physical Agent]], where the [[uses:Goal]] is whatever goals the Humans that make up the organization collectively do in practice, and the corresponding [[uses:Physical Agent World]] is just all the rest of the world sans the Organization.
