The purpose of this assignment is for you to craft a clear topic for your final project, and do the necessary preliminary preparation needed to complete that project. Too often for final papers, we put off working on them until the last minute. This assignment is intended to make sure we are doing work in enough time in advance to clarify the topic, find information, and identify any potential issues to be able to ask for extra support if needed. Hopefully, this will also demonstrate that doing a final project should be relatively easy if we are spacing out the prep work with enough time in advance.

It may be useful to read the prompts for the final project before continuing this section, so you have some idea of what this assignment is building towards.
This assignment has two parts:
1. Write a short proposal (1-2 paragraphs) for what you will write about in your final project (Read the guidelines later in this document for ideas and details.)
2. Create an annotated bibliography of works that you will likely use to address your topic. This should consist of:
	1. The full citation for the work, as you would write it in your bibliography/works cited page.
	2. Under each citation, write 2-5 sentences about what each work is about, and how it relates to your topic. Note that you donâ€™t need to have read the entire work to be able to write this, just enough so that you can mention the general topic and how it may relate to your paper.
This could mean that you just read the abstract for a paper, or part of the intro for a book.
3. Arrange your entries in alphabetical order, as you would for your bibliography/works cited
page.
4. Include 3-5 assigned works from the course syllabus that you may use to address your topic.
5. Find 3-5 additional sources published as books or in scholarly journals. These can be
things you have encountered elsewhere, such as other classes or personal reading. If you
need to search for additional sources, try using the search field at the library
website, which generally will return mostly academic results.
6. You may also list other outside sources that are not as scholarly, such as news articles, and
are encouraged to do so if that fits in with your project, but these must be in addition to the
works required by points 4-5
